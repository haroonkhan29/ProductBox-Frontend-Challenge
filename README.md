# Productbox Frontend Code Challenge

## Overview

Build RandoStore, an online store where users can add random items for sale and others can purchase them. Youâ€™ll create the frontend using ReactJS and the backend using NodeJS. The backend provides a simple REST API for managing items.

## The project screenshot is located in frontend/src/assets. You can view the project screenshot there.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   cd <project_folder>

2. Install Backend Dependencies
   Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend
